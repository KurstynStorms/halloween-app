Welcome to **Rotten Pumpkins**.

It's a little like Rotten Tomatoes, but more spooky and for your own personal use.

This application is useful for users who are serious fans of not only horror movies but films that 
center around Halloween themes. It is always fun and festive to rewatch your favorite Halloween films
this application makes it easier to recall which have really scared you and which are a little more
lighthearted. It is also useful in order to pick a movie that is family friendly if that is something
that's important to you.

You can access all of your favorite Halloween movies and rate them based on how scary they are by
clicking the My Movies tab in the navbar on the top right. From here you can click through in order
to find reviews you have left on each of your movies. You can also access these reviews by clicking 
the My Reviews tab in the navbar as well. 

There is a feature to add a movie or a review to your collection as well. If you have a change of 
heart about the film you can also go back in and edit your review. This will help keep your collection 
updated and will remind you during each Halloween season which movies are scariest. The scare rating 
attribute of each review makes it easy to determine which movie you might want to watch based on your mood.
