Welcome to **Rotten Pumpkins**.

It's a little like Rotten Tomatoes, but more spooky.

To install:

5. Enjoy.

You can access all of your favorite Halloween movies and rate them based on how scary they are by
clicking the My Movies tab in the navbar on the top right. From here you can click through in order
to find reviews you have left on each of your movies. You can also access these reviews by clicking 
the My Reviews tab in the navbar as well. 

You can also add a movie or a review to your collection. If you have a change of heart about the film
you can also go back in and edit your review. This will help keep your collection updated and will 
remind you during each Halloween season which movies are scariest and you can pick which movie to
watch based on your mood.
